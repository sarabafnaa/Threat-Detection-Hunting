# Threat Detection and Hunting

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **Threat Detection and Threat Hunting** techniques used to identify, analyze, and respond to malicious activities within enterprise environments.  
It brings together **open-source tools, detection rules, datasets, and frameworks** to support proactive cyber defense and blue-team operations.

The objective is to understand attacker behavior, map activities to **MITRE ATT&CK**, and improve detection engineering and incident response capabilities.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect malicious activities across **endpoint, network, and log data**
- Perform **proactive threat hunting** using hypothesis-driven techniques
- Map adversary behavior to **MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques**
- Analyze real-world datasets to identify attack patterns
- Improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives

## 🧠 Threat Hunting Methodology
1. Define threat hypothesis  
2. Identify relevant data sources  
3. Collect and normalize logs  
4. Apply detection logic  
5. Correlate events with MITRE ATT&CK  
6. Validate findings and document results
